* Singleton 				- enable to have just one taste factory 
* Flyweight					- minimizes memory usage by sharing already allocated tastes
* Adapter					- creates interface for using cake in nutrition meter
* Chain of responsibility 	- pass request along a chain of cooks to make crust, fill, whipped cream .....
* Iterator 					- iterate through delivery cakes. Also there is chocolate and vanilla/strawberry cake iterator.
